abstract = {This paper describes LFRic: the new weather and climate modelling system being developed by the UK Met Office to replace the existing Unified Model in preparation for exascale computing in the 2020s. LFRic uses the GungHo dynamical core and runs on a semi-structured cubed-sphere mesh. The design of the supporting infrastructure follows object-oriented principles to facilitate modularity and the use of external libraries where possible. In particular, a ‘separation of concerns' between the science code and parallel code is imposed to promote performance portability. An application called PSyclone, developed at the STFC Hartree centre, can generate the parallel code enabling deployment of a single source science code onto different machine architectures. This paper provides an overview of the scientific requirement, the design of the software infrastructure, and examples of PSyclone usage. Preliminary performance results show strong scaling and an indication that hybrid MPI/OpenMP performs better than pure MPI.},

abstract = {Although data partitioning is required to enable parallelism on distributed memory systems, data partitions are not first class objects in most distributed programming models. As a result, automatic parallelizers and application writers encode a particular partitioning strategy in the parallelized program, leading to a program not easily configured or composed with other parallel programs. We present a constraint-based approach to automatic data partitioning. By introducing abstractions for first-class data partitions, we express a space of correct partitioning strategies. Candidate partitions are characterized by partitioning constraints, which can be automatically inferred from data accesses in parallelizable loops. Constraints can be satisfied by synthesized partitioning code or user-provided partitions. We demonstrate that programs auto-parallelized in our approach are easily composed with manually parallelized parts and have scalability comparable to hand-optimized counterparts.},

abstract = {Moore's Law is a techno-economic model that has enabled the information technology industry to double the performance and functionality of digital electronics roughly every 2 years within a fixed cost, power and area. Advances in silicon lithography have enabled this exponential miniaturization of electronics, but, as transistors reach atomic scale and fabrication costs continue to rise, the classical technological driver that has underpinned Moore's Law for 50 years is failing and is anticipated to flatten by 2025. This article provides an updated view of what a post-exascale system will look like and the challenges ahead, based on our most recent understanding of technology roadmaps. It also discusses the tapering of historical improvements, and how it affects options available to continue scaling of successors to the first exascale machine. Lastly, this article covers the many different opportunities and strategies available to continue computing performance improvements in the absence of historical technology drivers. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Numerical algorithms for high-performance computational science'.},

abstract = {With semiconductor technology gradually approaching its physical and thermal limits, recent supercomputers have adopted major architectural changes to continue increasing the performance through more power-efficient heterogeneous many-core systems. Examples include Sunway TaihuLight that has four management processing elements (MPEs) and 256 computing processing elements (CPEs) inside one processor and Summit that has two central processing units (CPUs) and six graphics processing units (GPUs) inside one node. Meanwhile, current high-resolution Earth system models that desperately require more computing power generally consist of millions of lines of legacy code developed for traditional homogeneous multicore processors and cannot automatically benefit from the advancement of supercomputer hardware. As a result, refactoring and optimizing the legacy models for new architectures become key challenges along the road of taking advantage of greener and faster supercomputers, providing better support for the global climate research community and contributing to the long-lasting societal task of addressing long-term climate change. This article reports the efforts of a large group in the International Laboratory for High-Resolution Earth System Prediction (iHESP) that was established by the cooperation of Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM), Texas A{\&}M University (TAMU), and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), with the goal of enabling highly efficient simulations of the high-resolution (25 km atmosphere and 10 km ocean) Community Earth System Model (CESM-HR) on Sunway Taihu- Light. The refactoring and optimizing efforts have improved the simulation speed of CESM-HR from 1 SYPD (simulation years per day) to 3.4 SYPD (with output disabled) and supported several hundred years of pre-industrial control simulations. With further strategies on deeper refactoring and optimizing for remaining computing hotspots, as well as redesigning architecture-oriented algorithms, we expect an equivalent or even better efficiency to be gained on the new platform than traditional homogeneous CPU platforms. The refactoring and optimizing processes detailed in this paper on the Sunway system should have implications for similar efforts on other heterogeneous many-core systems such as GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) systems.},

A more aggressive and fner-grained redesign is then applied on the CAM, to achieve fner memory control and usage, more efficient vectorization and compute and communication overlapping. We further improve the CAM performance of a 260-core Sunway processor to the range of 28 to 184 Intel CPU cores, and achieve a sustainable double-precision performance of 3.3 PFlops for a 750 m global simulation when using 10,075,000 cores.

To express on-node parallelism we use the C++ library Kokkos, which allows us to achieve a performance portable code in a largely architecture-independent way. Our C++ implementation is at least as fast as the original Fortran implementation on IBM Power9 and Intel Knights Landing processors, proving that the code refactor did not compromise the efficiency on CPU architectures.

abstract = {This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

abstract = {Performing Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation on hardware accelerators efficiently is challenging. Existing DNN frameworks and compilers often treat the DNN operators in a data flow graph (DFG) as opaque library functions and schedule them onto accelerators to be executed individually. They rely on another layer of scheduler, often implemented in hardware, to exploit the parallelism available in the operators. Such a two-layered approach incurs significant scheduling overhead and often cannot fully utilize the available hardware resources. In this paper, we propose RAM-MER, a DNN compiler design that optimizes the execution of DNN workloads on massively parallel accelerators. RAM-MER generates an efficient static spatio-temporal schedule for a DNN at compile time to minimize scheduling overhead. It maximizes hardware utilization by holistically exploiting parallelism through inter-and intra-operator co-scheduling. RAMMER achieves this by proposing several novel, hardware neutral, and clean abstractions for the computation tasks and the hardware accelerators. These abstractions expose a much richer scheduling space to RAMMER, which employs several heuristics to explore this space and finds efficient schedules. We implement RAMMER for multiple hardware backends such as NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Graphcore IPU. Experiments show RAMMER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compilers such as TensorFlow XLA and TVM by up to 20.1×. It also outperforms TensorRT, a vendor optimized proprietary DNN inference library from NVIDIA, by up to 3.1×.},

However, the small batch sizes typical in online inference results in poor GPU utilization, a potential performance gap which GPU resource sharing can address. In this paper, we explore several techniques to leverage both temporal and spatial multiplexing to improve GPU utilization for deep learning inference workloads. We evaluate the performance trade-offs of each approach with respect to resource-efficiency, latency predictability, and isolation when compared with conventional batched inference. Our experimental analysis suggests up to a 5x potential for improved utilization through the exploration of more advanced spatial and temporal multiplexing strategies. Our preliminary prototype of a dynamic space-time scheduler demonstrates a 3.23x floating-point throughput increase over space-only multiplexing and a 7.73x increase over time-only multiplexing for convolutions, while also providing better isolation and latency predictability.},

Legate works by translating NumPy programs to the Legion programming model and then leverages the scalability of the Legion runtime system to distribute data and computations across an arbitrary sized machine.

abstract = {As we enter the era of GPU computing, demanding applications with substantial parallelism increasingly use the massively parallel computing capabilities of GPUs to achieve superior performance and efficiency. Today GPU computing enables applications that we previously thought infeasible because of long execution times. With the GPU's rapid evolution from a configurable graphics processor to a pro-grammable parallel processor, the ubiquitous GPU in every PC, laptop, desktop, and workstation is a many-core multi-threaded multiprocessor that excels at both graphics and computing applications. Today's GPUs use hundreds of parallel processor cores executing tens of thousands of parallel threads to rapidly solve large problems having substantial inherent parallelism. They're now the most pervasive massively parallel processing platform ever available, as well as the most cost-effective. Using NVIDIA GPUs as examples, this article describes the evolution of GPU computing and its parallel computing model, the enabling architecture and software developments , how computing applications use CPUþGPU coprocessing, example application performance speedups, and trends in GPU computing. GPU computing's evolution Why have GPUs evolved to have large numbers of parallel threads and many cores? The driving force continues to be the real-time graphics performance needed to render complex, high-resolution 3D scenes at interactive frame rates for games. Rendering high-definition graphics scenes is a problem with tremendous inherent par-allelism. A graphics programmer writes a single-thread program that draws one pixel, and the GPU runs multiple instances of this thread in parallel-drawing multiple pixels in parallel. Graphics programs, written in shading languages such as Cg or High-Level Shading Language (HLSL), thus scale transparently over a wide range of thread and processor parallelism. Also, GPU computing programs-written in C or Cþþ with the CUDA parallel computing model, 1,2 or using a parallel computing API inspired by CUDA such as Direct-Compute 3 or OpenCL 4-scale transparently over a wide range of parallelism. Software scalability, too, has enabled GPUs to rapidly increase their parallelism and performance with increasing transistor density.},

At a grid spacing of 930 m (1.9 km), we achieve a simulation throughput of 0.043 (0.23) simulated years per day and an energy consumption of 596 MWh per simulated year. Furthermore , we propose a new memory usage efficiency (MUE) metric that considers how efficiently the memory bandwidth-the dominant bottleneck of climate codes-is being used.},

abstract = {Modern parallel architectures have both heterogeneous processors and deep, complex memory hierarchies. We present Legion, a programming model and runtime system for achieving high performance on these machines. Legion is organized around logical regions, which express both locality and independence of program data, and tasks, functions that perform computations on regions. We describe a runtime system that dynamically extracts parallelism from Legion programs, using a distributed, parallel scheduling algorithm that identifies both independent tasks and nested parallelism. Legion also enables explicit, programmer controlled movement of data through the memory hierarchy and placement of tasks based on locality information via a novel mapping interface. We evaluate our Legion implementation on three applications: fluid-flow on a regular grid, a three-level AMR code solving a heat diffusion equation, and a circuit simulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},
